# Cave Convolute
An RPG dungeon-crawler game: scurry your way through a paradoxically-connected haunted cave system, collecting items and power-ups, battling monsters, and striking deals with the cave-dwellers that might just save your life. . .

## Behind the scenes: A Non-Euclidean Adventure
Although at first glance the game seems like a normal rogue-like, there is more than meets the eye. The cave system that the player wanders through is actually a set of computer-generated pieces stitched together, creating infinite loops that would be impossible in normal Euclidean geometry. This makes each new game a fresh and perplexing escape puzzle!
